					<p><i>Vaporwave</i> is a microgenre of electronic music and an Internet meme that emerged in the
						early 2010s. The style is defined by its appropriation of 1980s and 1990s mood music styles such
						as smooth jazz, elevator music, R&B, and lounge music, typically sampling or manipulating tracks
						via chopped and screwed techniques and other effects. Its surrounding subculture is sometimes
						associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism and popular culture, and
						tends to be characterized by a nostalgic or surrealist engagement with the popular
						entertainment, technology and advertising of previous decades. It also incorporates early
						Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, anime, 3D-rendered objects, and cyberpunk
						tropes in its cover artwork and music videos.</p>
					<p>Originating as an ironic variant of chillwave, <i>vaporwave</i> was loosely derived from the
						experimental tendencies of the mid-2000s hypnagogic pop scene. The style was pioneered by
						producers such as James Ferraro, Daniel Lopatin, and Ramona Xavier under various pseudonyms. A
						circle of online producers were particularly inspired by Xavier's Floral Shoppe (2011), which
						established a blueprint for the genre. The movement subsequently built an audience on sites
						Last.fm, Reddit, and 4chan while a flood of new acts, many operating under online pseudonyms,
						turned to Bandcamp for distribution. Following the wider exposure of vaporwave in 2012, a wealth
						of subgenres and offshoots emerged, such as future funk, mallsoft, and hardvapour.</p>

						<h3>Ｃｈａｒａｃｔｅｒｉｓｔｉｃｓ　ドそヹ</h3>
						<p>Building on the experimental and ironic tendencies of genres such as chillwave and hypnagogic
							pop, vaporwave is an Internet-based style that draws primarily on musical and cultural
							sources from the 1980s and early 1990s, with the music made of "brief, cut-up sketches",
							cleanly produced, and composed almost entirely from samples, along with the application of
							slowed-down chopped and screwed techniques, looping, and other effects.</p>

					<div class="image flush"><img style="width: 55%;margin-left: 110px;" src="images/8.png" alt="" />
					</div>
					<div class="inner" style="color: black">

						<p>The style's visual aesthetic (often stylized as "ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣＳ", with fullwidth characters)
							incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, and cyberpunk
							tropes, as well as anime, Greco-Roman statues, and 3D-rendered objects.VHS degradation is
							another common effect seen in vaporwave art.Generally, artists limit their source material
							between Japan's economic flourishment in the 1980s and the September 11 attacks or dot-com
							bubble burst of 2001 (some albums, including Floral Shoppe, depict the intact Twin Towers on
							their covers).</p>

						<h3>Ｈｉｓｔｏｒｙ　依ゐ液</h3>
						<p>Vaporwave originated on the Internet as an ironic variant of the 2000s internet-based genre
							chillwave, drawing on the retro style's "analog nostalgia" as well as the work of hypnagogic
							pop artists such as Ariel Pink and James Ferraro, who were also characterized by the
							invocation of retro popular culture. "Hypnagogic pop" was coined by Wire journalist David
							Keenan only a few weeks after "chillwave", and the two terms were often used interchangeably
							with each other and "vaporwave". According to Vice, vaporwave was one of several short-lived
							internet genres to emerge during the era: "there was chillwave, witch house, seapunk,
							shitgaze, vaporwave, cloud rap, and countless other niche sounds with gimmicky names. As
							soon as one microgenre flamed out, another would take its place, and with it a whole new set
							of beats, buzz artists, and fashion trends."</p>
